# Turning "transmission probability" into units Geant wants

The data in the `.txt` file in this directory is extracted from
    [Chen+2007](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4291695).
It is transmittance probability through a 20cm LSO crystal.
Closest thing to a 20cm LYSO crystal we could find.

## UPDATE: found data for LYSO:Ce
- [Addesa+2022](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-0221/17/08/P08028)
- Still need to digitize it though
